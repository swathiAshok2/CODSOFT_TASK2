Iris Classification - Power BI Analysis📌 

**Project Overview**

This project involves analyzing and visualizing the Iris dataset using Power BI. 
The dataset consists of 150 flower samples categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal is to explore relationships between features and classify species using data visualization techniques.

**Columns:**
Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Species (Target variable: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

🎯**ObjectivesPerform data cleaning and preprocessing using Power Query**
1.Explore summary statistics and feature distribution.
2.Visualize relationships between features using scatter plots, clustered bar charts
3.Build an interactive Power BI dashboard.

🛠️ **Tools & TechnologiesPower BI (Data visualization & dashboard creation)**

Power Query (Data transformation)
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) (For custom calculations)

📊 **Key Visualizations Summary Statistics**: Card visuals displaying sum values of features.
**Scatter Plot**: Visualizing petal length vs. petal width with species as a legend.
**Bar Char**t: Showing species distribution across the dataset.
**Interactive Filters**: Allowing users to explore data by species.

🚀 How to Load the Dataset into Power BI (Get Data → CSV)
Transform Data using Power Query (rename columns, ensure correct data types)
Create Visuals using the Visualizations pane
Apply Filters & Formatting for better insights

📌 **Insights & Findings**
The dataset forms three distinct clusters based on petal length and petal width.
Setosa species is clearly separable from the other two species.
Petal features provide better classification than sepal features.

📈 Future EnhancementsImplement a machine learning model in Python or Power BI for automatic classification.
Compare Power BI visuals with Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
